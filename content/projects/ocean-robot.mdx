# Autonomous Ocean Cleaning Robot

This project involved designing the electronics and firmware for autonomous boats that collect plastic waste from oceans. The boats use solar power and advanced navigation systems to efficiently clean polluted waterways.

I was responsible for the complete PCB design using KiCAD and writing the firmware in C++. The system includes GPS navigation, obstacle avoidance sensors, and wireless communication for remote monitoring.

## Key Features

- Solar-powered operation for extended missions
- GPS navigation with path planning algorithms
- Obstacle detection and avoidance system
- Wireless telemetry for remote monitoring
- Automated waste collection mechanism

## Technical Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was designing a power-efficient system that could operate reliably in harsh marine environments. This required careful component selection, waterproofing considerations, and robust firmware design.

## Power Management

The power management system was designed to:

1. Harvest solar energy efficiently
2. Store excess energy in high-capacity batteries
3. Intelligently distribute power to various subsystems
4. Implement power-saving modes for extended operation

## Navigation System

The navigation system uses a combination of:

- GPS for global positioning
- IMU for orientation and movement detection
- Computer vision for local obstacle detection
- Custom path planning algorithms for efficient coverage

## Results

The prototype has successfully demonstrated autonomous operation in controlled environments, with field tests showing promising results in real-world conditions. The next phase of development will focus on scaling the system for larger areas and improving the waste collection mechanism.
